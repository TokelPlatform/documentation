#### Give this address to the entity that will be sending you the TKL coins

This is your TKL coin address. This address is the associated address with the private key/WIF or seed phrase you input at login. It can be used to send/receive TKL coins. As Komodo and it's smart chains use the same types of addresses, you can also use the same private key/WIF or seed phrase on the Komodo (and other smart chain) blockchains, to send/receive funds from the same address.

If you'd like to check the balance of this address accross Komodo and all of it's smart chains, you can use this asset viewer.
